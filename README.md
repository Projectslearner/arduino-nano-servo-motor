# Servo Motor

#### Project Overview

The Servo Motor project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using an Arduino Nano. Servo motors are widely used in robotics and automation for precise control of angular position. This project sweeps the servo motor back and forth between 0 and 180 degrees, showcasing its movement capability.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Servo Motor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Servo Motor to Arduino Nano:**
   - **Signal Pin:** Connect to digital pin 9 on the Arduino Nano.
   - **Power (VCC) Pin:** Connect to the 5V pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - **Ground (GND) Pin:** Connect to any GND pin on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the servo motor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, observe the movement of the servo motor.
   - The servo motor will sweep back and forth between 0 and 180 degrees.

#### Applications

- **Robotics:** Use servo motors to actuate joints and control movements in robotic systems.
- **Automation:** Employ servo motors for precise positioning in automated machinery and equipment.
- **Camera Gimbal:** Utilize servo motors to stabilize and control the orientation of cameras and sensors.

#### Notes

- Ensure the servo motor is securely connected and powered appropriately to prevent damage.
- Adjust the delay value in the code to control the speed of the servo motor's movement.
- Experiment with different servo motors and angles to suit the specific requirements of your project.
